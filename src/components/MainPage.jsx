        <p className="mission-text">
          At SwaNik, our mission goes beyond simply connecting people to stray dogs.
          We believe in the power of compassion, the strength of community, and the
          transformative effect of kindness. Every stray dog deserves a second chance;
          a warm home, a full belly, and the love of a family. Our mission is to make
          that possible, one paw at a time.
        </p>

            <h3>Report a Stray</h3>
            <p>
              If you spot a stray dog in need, you can identify and share the exact
              location of a stray in need and capture their current condition with
              detailed descriptions.
